# alphabetter

Make working with different alphabets better! (get it?)

`alphabetter` is a package for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) which provides utilities for working with non-Latin alphabets easier:

- Force text direction LTR
- Disable joining of Arabic characters and space them widely
- Highlight hidden [non-]spacing characters

It is developed by Digital Grammars AB for internal use, but shared here for anyone who finds it useful.

Note this package is _not_ distributed through Atom's package library.
